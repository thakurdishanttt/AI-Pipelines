# Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview
The Document Processing Pipeline is a system designed to process, analyze, and transform documents efficiently. It supports various stages of document processing, including ingestion, parsing, transformation, and output generation.

## Features
- **Document Ingestion**: Supports multiple input formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **Parsing and Analysis**: Extracts structured data from unstructured documents.
- **Transformation**: Applies custom transformations to the extracted data.
- **Output Generation**: Exports processed data in desired formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).



## Usage
1. Configure the pipeline by editing the configuration file (`config.json`).
2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Processed documents will be saved in the `output` directory.
